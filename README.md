# outfit-recommender
an outfit recommendation engine based on a multi-classifier approach.
this project consists of the codes for creating models to classify clothes image input into associated classes for these features: `gender`, `masterCategory`, `subCategory`, `articleType`, `season`, `usage`, `color`.
as well as contains a script that recommends the desired number of complementary clothes (from given images) based on a tailored rule-based system.
